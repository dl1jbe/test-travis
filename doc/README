Make sure you have user r/w permissions on /tmp/tlf. The rest is
read-only.

To start a new contest (or a general- of dexpedition log) copy the
constest specific file from <PREFIX>/share/tlf/examples/<contestname>/,
being:   logcfg.dat into a working directory.

At this moment  examples for the wpx, cqww, eu-sprint, qso, dxpedition mode,
arrl-fd, arrl-dx, and pacc exist.

Meanwhile, as soon as you have understood the logcfg.dat file (which
should not be too difficult) you will be able to make your own for the
 contests covered.

Be sure to change the callsign in the logcfg.dat file. You can use any
editor, or ":set" or ":cfg"  from within the tlf program.

INSTALLATION
============

See INSTALL

STARTING TLF
============

TLF is started from the working directory with: tlf  (or ./tlf or e.g. /usr/local/bin/tlf)

Under X, you may have to set the terminal type.
Under Suse and RH 7.2 the KDE Konsole works fine, under Slackware 8.0 I have to
use TERM=rxvt. Best bet is the linux text console (separate consoles for tlf
and packet, see below).

PACKET SUPPORT
==============

TLF can also run packet in a separate terminal. To link this to the tlf program
start a telnet session from the working directory with:

telnet <network node> | tee -a  clfile

In case your packet program is on your own machine, use

telnet localhost | tee -a clfile

Now you have a separate packet terminal where you can e.g. start "call", telnet  or
or "minicom" and connect to your favorite dx cluster, or telnet to a cluster
on the internet.

Activate "FIFOINTERFACE".

Activate the cluster display in tlf with :cluster, :spot, or :map
You can toggle the announcements filter with :filter

CW
==

See the manual... I prefer to use the cwdaemon for the parallel port.
